This is my school project: System for preparing for the exam (ЕГЭ).

This project was created in 10th class when I didn't hear about the OOP paradigm.

This explains the wrong approach to the development of the project, which makes it impossible to further support it.

There are no images required for the program to work.

Here is the full version of the project: drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SNrSzRGIqlWUZ4J7Q6dckMi5EBbJbqhf?usp=sharing

Go easy on me :)
